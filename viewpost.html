                        <h2>Sofia - the social Robot?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Sophia was created by Hanson Robotics in collaboration with AI developers, including Google’s
                        parent company Alphabet Inc, who built her voice recognition system, and SingularityNET, which
                        powers her brain.[5]

                        Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015.[6] The robot, modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn,[7]
                        is known for her human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants.
                        According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data
                        processing and facial recognition. Sophia also imitates human gestures and facial expressions
                        and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics
                        (e.g. on the weather).[8] Sophia uses voice recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent
                        company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time.[6] Sophia's intelligence software
                        is designed by SingularityNET.[9] The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that
                        allows her to improve responses in the future.[10]

                        Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, or to help
                        crowds at large events or parks. He has said that he hopes that the robot can ultimately
                        interact with other humans sufficiently to gain social skills.[11]

                        Sophia has seven robot humanoid “siblings” who were also created by Hanson Robotics.[12] Fellow
                        Hanson robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, Bina48, Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K.
                        Dick Android, Zeno[12], and Joey Chaotic[13]. In December 2017, fellow Hanson robot BINA48
                        passed a college course on philosophy and love taught by Professor William J. Barry at Notre
                        Dame de Namur University.[14]
